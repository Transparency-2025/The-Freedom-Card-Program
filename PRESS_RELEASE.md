#### **Headline: Green Light for Beara Youth: Scoil Phobail Bhéara Launches Initiative to Drive Student Mobility and Fuel Local Economy**

**Castletownbere, West Cork – [Date]** – Scoil Phobail Bhéara is proud to announce the launch of **The Beara Drive Initiative**, a pioneering program designed to empower students by removing financial barriers to obtaining a driver’s license, a vital necessity for life and work on the Beara Peninsula.

The program, supported by dedicated local sponsors, incentivizes students to complete the required 12 Essential Driver Training (EDT) lessons and sit their official driving test by their 19th birthday.

> "In Castletownbere, a driving license is not a luxury, it's an essential skill for independence and employment," said **[Principal’s Name], Principal of Scoil Phobail Bhéara.** "We are tackling the financial hurdle of lessons head-on, ensuring our graduates are road-ready for job opportunities in the fishing, marine, and tourism sectors right here in West Cork."

#### **A Vested Interest in Local Success**

The initiative features an innovative funding mechanism: students are rewarded with **"Beara Advantage Gift Cards"** upon hitting key milestones (e.g., passing the theory test, completing Lesson 6, booking the final test).

Crucially, these gift cards are only redeemable at local, participating retailers, hospitality businesses, and services within the Castletownbere and wider West Cork area.

> "This is a true circular economy model," stated **[Sponsor Name/Title, e.g., CEO of Castletownbere Fishermen's Co-op].** "Our investment in the students of Scoil Phobail Bhéara instantly feeds back into our local shops and businesses. We are investing in our future workforce while simultaneously supporting the backbone of our community."

The school is currently working with businesses across the Beara Peninsula to ensure maximum acceptance of the "Beara Advantage Gift Cards." Any business owner wishing to support this project and join the redemption network can contact the school office.

#### **Student Applications**

Current senior cycle students can apply immediately by reviewing and signing the **Student Commitment Charter**, available from the school office. Grants will be awarded on a phased basis to reward dedication and progress.
