Here is a robust **Sponsorship Pitch Letter** designed to be sent to major local employers (e.g., Castletownbere Fishermen's Co-op, Marine Harvest, Murphy’s SuperValu, and local hospitality groups).

I have also included a **Sponsorship Tiers** attachment to make the financial "ask" clear and professional.

### Document D: Corporate Sponsorship Request Letter

**Subject:** Investing in our Youth & Our Local Economy: The [Insert Program Name]

**Date:** [Date]

**To:** [Name of CEO/Manager], [Company Name]

**From:** [Your Name/Committee Name]
**Re:** A Strategic Partnership with Scoil Phobail Bhéara

Dear [Name],

Living on the Beara Peninsula offers an incredible quality of life, but we all know the challenges our geography presents. For the young people of **Scoil Phobail Bhéara**, transport is the single biggest barrier to employment, further education, and independence. Without a driver’s license, their opportunities are limited.

We are writing to invite [Company Name] to become a founding partner of **[Insert Program Name, e.g., The Beara Drive Initiative]**.

**The Mission**
This program incentivizes students to complete their 12 Essential Driver Training (EDT) lessons and pass their driving test by age 19. We do not just hand out funds; we reward milestones. When a student progresses (e.g., passes the theory test, completes Lesson 6, sits the full exam), they unlock funding to help cover costs.

**The Local Twist: A Circular Economy**
Uniquely, this program is designed to support *you* and the wider West Cork business community.
Funding is distributed to students exclusively via **Restricted Gift Cards/Vouchers**.
* These funds **cannot** be spent on international websites or outside the approved network.
* They **must** be redeemed at participating local retailers, shops, garages, and hospitality venues in Castletownbere and the greater Beara/West Cork area.

**Why Partner With Us?**
1.  **Workforce Readiness:** By helping students get on the road, you are directly expanding the pool of mobile, employable young people available to work for [Company Name].
2.  **Economic Stimulus:** Your sponsorship donation effectively "boomerangs" back into the local economy. Every Euro you donate is spent in a local business.
3.  **Community Impact:** You will be publicly recognized as a key driver of youth development in Beara.

**Our Request**
We are seeking a sponsorship of **[€ Amount]** to launch the pilot phase of this program. This contribution would support [Number] students through their full driver education.

We would be delighted to meet with you briefly next week to show you the program roadmap and discuss how we can feature [Company Name]’s branding on our materials.

Le meas,

### Phase 6: Operational Next Step (Risk Management)

You now have the *Name*, the *Structure*, and the *Funding Pitch*. The next critical piece is the **Student Contract**.

We must ensure the students understand this is a "social contract"—if they stop their lessons, the funding stops.
