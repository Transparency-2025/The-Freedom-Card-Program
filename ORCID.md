The most suitable **Work Type** for a project like "The Freedom Card Program / The Beara Drive Initiative" on ORCID would be **Report** or **Protocol**.

Here is a breakdown of why these fit best, based on the nature of your comprehensive documentation:

### **1. Primary Recommendation: Report**

| Work Type | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Report** | This is the most appropriate classification for a comprehensive, multi-faceted body of work that documents the structure, financial viability, and planned evaluation of an initiative. Your document suite (including the SOFA, Implementation Handbook, and Evaluation Scorecards) functions as a detailed operational and feasibility **report** on a new social program. |

### **2. Strong Alternative: Protocol**

| Work Type | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Protocol** | This is an excellent choice if you want to highlight the innovative aspects of the program structure. The "Hybrid Milestone Model" and the "Circular Economy" funding mechanism are novel **protocols** for managing student incentives and local economic retention. |

### **3. Secondary Listing (for specific files): Data Set**

If you eventually publish the anonymised outcomes tracked in the `INTERNAL_TRACKING.md` and measured by the `IMPACT SCORECARD`, you could also list the results as a separate **Data set**. This is crucial if the data will be used in future academic papers (like the ones mentioned in your `RESEARCH_OVERVIEW`).
