This email focuses on the core logistical need: setting up the restricted network and branding the card. I will use placeholders for the Card Provider and initial estimated volume.

**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry: Custom Restricted Gift Card Program for Scoil Phobail Bhéara (West Cork, Ireland)

**To:** [Name of Partnerships/Sales Contact, e.g., Head of Corporate Sales] @ [Gift Card Provider Name]
**From:** [Your Name/Program Coordinator]
**CC:** [Principal's Name]
**Date:** [Current Date]

Dear [Name of Contact],

I am writing on behalf of **Scoil Phobail Bhéara (Castletownbere Secondary School)** to initiate a partnership regarding our newly launched student incentive program: **The Beara Drive Initiative.**

The program provides prepaid financial grants to senior cycle students who achieve key milestones in their driver education (e.g., passing the theory test, completing driving lessons).

#### **The Core Requirement: Local Circular Economy**

Our program is unique in that it is built on a "circular economy" model. Our goal is not just to support students, but also to financially invest in the local economy of the Beara Peninsula and West Cork.

**We require a gift card solution that meets the following criteria:**

1.  **Branding:** Ability to produce a physical card branded with our logo: "The Beara Advantage Card."
2.  **Restriction:** The platform must allow for **Merchant Category Code (MCC) restriction** and, ideally, **geographic restriction** to limit spending to West Cork/County Cork. We need to prevent leakage to major online retailers or national chains outside our agreed partner network.
3.  **Scalability:** The ability to reload cards as students hit new milestones (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).

#### **Initial Scope & Next Steps**

We anticipate an initial order of **[Estimate number, e.g., 100]** physical cards, with an initial load value totaling approximately **€[Estimated Total Value, e.g., €15,000]**. This program has secured strong local sponsorship and is set for a launch date in **[Month, e.g., September 2026]**.

Could you please provide us with a detailed proposal outlining the following:
* Your capacity to meet the required MCC/geographic restrictions.
* The typical timeline for contract finalization and card design/production.
* The transaction fees associated with retailer acceptance.

We are keen to begin the design phase immediately. Please let me know your availability for a brief introductory call next week.

Thank you for helping us drive mobility and economic growth in the Beara Peninsula.

Sincerely,

**[Your Name]**
Program Coordinator, The Beara Drive Initiative
