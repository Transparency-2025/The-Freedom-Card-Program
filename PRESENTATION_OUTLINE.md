| Time | Speaker Cue | Script Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00** | (High Energy) | **Good morning, Scoil Phobail Bhéara!** Quick show of hands: Who here is tired of begging Mam or Dad for a lift? Who needs a car to get to that summer job in the tourist season? (Wait for reaction). Exactly. Living on the Beara Peninsula, a driver’s license isn't a luxury—it’s **your freedom.** |
| **1:00** | **The Problem** | We know the biggest hurdle isn't passing the test—it's the cost. Lessons are expensive. Insurance is expensive. So, we partnered with the community—from the fishing industry to our local shops—to solve that problem for you. |
| **2:30** | **The Investment** | Today, we are launching **The Beara Drive Initiative.** This is the school and community—thank you to all our local sponsors—investing directly in **your future mobility.** We have secured funding to give you financial support at every stage of your journey to getting that full license. |
| **3:30** | **The Mechanism** | **Crucially, we don't give you cash.** We give you the **Beara Advantage Card!** This is a restricted gift card. You earn money on the card by hitting your driving milestones, and you spend it right here in West Cork. |
| **4:30** | **The Local Loop** | This is the clever part. Our sponsors gave money to the school. We give you the card. **And you spend it back in the local shops and restaurants!** That money never leaves Castletownbere. It stays here to support *our* community. That's why your card is restricted—it's about investing locally. |
| **5:30** | **The Roadmap: 3 Steps to Success** | This isn't a handout; it's a reward for commitment. There are three stages where you unlock funding. (Explain that they will see this roadmap clearly on the application charter). |
| **6:30** | **TIER 1: The Starter Boost** | **The Goal:** Get your Learner Permit and book your first lesson. **The Reward:** A substantial top-up to help you pay that first lesson block! |
| **7:30** | **TIER 2: The Momentum Grant** | **The Goal:** Complete the hardest part—EDT Lesson 6 (The Halfway Point). **The Reward:** A big boost to keep the lessons going right through to Lesson 12. |
| **8:30** | **TIER 3: The Finish Line** | **The Goal:** Book and sit your official RSA Driving Test. **The Reward:** Final funding to help with test fees, car hire, or your first tank of fuel! (Remember, you get this whether you pass or fail—we reward the effort). |
| **9:30** | **Action & Q&A** | **Who is eligible?** Any student in Senior Cycle. **What's the first step?** Come to the school office and pick up your **Student Commitment Charter** (Document F). Read it carefully with your parents, sign it, and bring us a copy of your Learner Permit. That’s it! |
| **10:30** | (Closing) | We are excited to see you on the road. Let’s make this initiative a huge success for Castletownbere! Thank you to our incredible local sponsors. |
