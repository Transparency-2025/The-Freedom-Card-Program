A Statement of Financial Activities (SOFA) is the correct financial statement for a charitable organisation in Ireland, aligning with the requirements of the **Charities Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP)**.

The key feature of the **Statement of Financial Activities (SOFA)** is the mandatory distinction between **Restricted** and **Unrestricted** funds, which shows sponsors exactly how their donations were used.

Here is the **Projected Statement of Financial Activities (SOFA)** for The Beara Drive Initiative – Year 1.

### Analysis of the Projected SOFA

This statement highlights a key financial challenge:

1.  **Restricted Funds:** You have a small **surplus of €600** in Restricted Funds. This is positive; it shows that your sponsorship covers the core program costs and leaves a small contingency for the card program in Year 2.
    * *(Note: This €600 must still be used on the card program, as it is restricted.)*
2.  **Unrestricted Funds:** You have a **deficit of (€500)** in Unrestricted Funds (€1,500 Income - €2,000 Expense). This means the administrative and operational costs are exceeding the general community donations you projected.
    * **Action Required:** To avoid operating at a loss, you must either find an additional €500 in general fundraising *or* reduce administrative costs (e.g., reduce the Coordinator stipend/printing budget).

This SOFA acts as a critical management tool, forcing a realistic review of administrative funding before the program officially launches.
