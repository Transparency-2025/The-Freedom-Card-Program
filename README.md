### Research & Development

- [Driving & Economic Mobility - Rural vs Urban](https://github.com/Transparency-2025/The-Freedom-Card-Program/blob/main/RESEARCH_OVERVIEW_ECONOMIC_MOBILITY.md) - Research into the impact of driving licensure, location, and demographics on economic mobility in Ireland reveals a stark "two-tier" system.

Documentation of the initiative to support economic mobility and employment in West Cork.

Given the geography of the Beara Peninsula, holding a driver’s license is not just a convenience; it is an essential tool for economic mobility and employment.

Here is a comprehensive suite of documents and strategies to launch this program at **Scoil Phobail Bhéara (Castletownbere Community School)**.

---

### Phase 1: Naming Options
We need a name that signals mobility, local pride, and future opportunity.

* **Option 1 (Direct & Local):** *The Beara Drive Initiative*
* **Option 2 (Action-Oriented):** *Green Light Beara*
* **Option 3 (Community Focused):** *Beara Road Ready*
* **Option 4 (Youth Focused):** *Next Mile West Cork*
* **Option 5 (The "Gift" Angle):** *The Freedom Card Program*

---

### Phase 2: Program Structure Strategy
*To be included in the Internal Strategy Document.*

**The "Hybrid Milestone" Model (Recommended)**
To ensure students don't just take the money and quit, but also have support upfront, a tiered approach is best.

* **Tier 1: The Starter Boost (20% of funds):** Awarded upon provisional license acquisition and proof of booking the first driving lesson.
* **Tier 2: The Momentum Grant (40% of funds):** Awarded after completing EDT Lesson 6 (halfway point).
* **Tier 3: The Completion Reward (40% of funds):** Awarded upon taking the driving test (regardless of pass/fail, to reduce anxiety, though a "Pass Bonus" could be added by sponsors).

### Phase 3: Documentation Suite

#### Document A: Program Overview & Mission Statement
**Target Audience:** School Board, Parents, Sponsors (e.g., Castletownbere Fishermen's Co-op, SuperValu).

> **Program Title:** The Beara Drive Initiative
> **Location:** Castletownbere, West Cork
>
> **Mission:** To empower the youth of the Beara Peninsula with essential mobility skills while reinvesting in the local economy. We aim to remove the financial barrier to driving for students of Scoil Phobail Bhéara, ensuring they are road-ready for employment and education by age 19.
>
> **The Mechanism:**
> Funds are distributed via the **"Beara Advantage Card"** (a closed-loop or restricted Visa/One4All card).
> * **Student Benefit:** Subsidized driving lessons and test fees.
> * **Community Benefit:** The rewards card is redeemable *only* at participating local retailers, cafes, and service providers in Castletownbere and West Cork. This creates a circular economy where education funding supports local business.

#### Document B: Merchant/Retailer "Opt-In" One-Pager
**Target Audience:** Local business owners (Murphy’s SuperValu, MacCarthy’s Bar, local clothing stores, driving instructors).

> **Subject: Drive Business while Driving Change – Join the Beara Advantage Network**
>
> Dear [Business Owner Name],
>
> We are launching **The Beara Drive Initiative** to help Scoil Phobail Bhéara students afford their driving lessons. However, we want this funding to stay here in Castletownbere.
>
> **How it works:**
> Students earn "Beara Advantage" gift cards by completing driving milestones. We want them to spend these cards in **your** shop/business.
>
> **Why Opt-In?**
> 1.  **Guaranteed Local Spend:** The funds cannot be spent on Amazon or foreign websites. They must be spent with participating partners like you.
> 2.  **Zero Hassle:** The card works exactly like a standard Visa/Debit card or One4All voucher. If you have a card terminal, you are ready.
> 3.  **Community Goodwill:** You will be listed as a "Youth Mobility Supporter" in all school newsletters and local press.
>
> **Cost to you:**
> Free to join. Standard card processing fees apply (same as any customer using a card).
>
> **[Scan QR Code to Opt-In as a Participating Retailer]**

#### Document C: Student Application & Roadmap
**Target Audience:** Secondary-Level Sudents

> **Get Your License. Get Rewarded.**
>
> **The Deal:** Driving is expensive. We are here to help.
>
> **How to Earn Funding:**
> 1.  **Register:** Sign up at the school office.
> 2.  **Get Provisional:** Show us your learner permit = **Receive €X Voucher.**
> 3.  **Drive:** Complete 6 EDT Lessons = **Receive €X Voucher.**
> 4.  **The Final Mile:** Show proof of Sitting the Driving Test = **Receive €X Voucher.**
>
> **Where to use your vouchers:**
> Your "Beara Drive" card is accepted at [List of Local Spots] for food, clothes, fuel, or even more driving lessons.

### Phase 4: The Technical Solution (Gift Card Logistics)

To ensure the "easiest opt-in" while maintaining local focus, you have three technical options. I have ranked them by suitability for this project.

**Option 1: The "Town & City Gift Card" Platform (Highly Recommended)**
There are existing providers (like Miconex) that create "The West Cork Gift Card."
* **Pros:** It runs on the Mastercard network but is "locked" to a specific list of local businesses.
* **Merchant Opt-in:** They don't need new hardware. They just swipe the card, and the system recognises their Merchant ID.
* **Expansion:** You can start with Castletownbere merchants, then unlock Bantry/Skibbereen merchants later.

**Option 2: Partnership with "One4All"**
* **Pros:** widely recognised, students love them.
* **Cons:** One4All charges retailers a commission to accept the card. Small local shops in Beara might resist this. One4All is also accepted at major chains (Penney's, TK Maxx), meaning money might leave the Beara Peninsula immediately.

**Option 3: Restricted Prepaid Visa (Swirl/Perx)**
* **Pros:** Highest acceptance rate.
* **Cons:** Hard to restrict *only* to local shops. Students could spend it online or in Cork City easily.

**Recommendation:** Go with **Option 1 (Town Gift Card style)** or a **Restricted Loop Visa**. This ensures the "Local first, County second" requirement is met.

### Phase 5: Implementation Timeline

| Timeline | Action Item |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Month 1** | **Merchant Recruitment:** Walk Main Street Castletownbere. Get the driving instructors and 10 key retailers (food/retail) to agree. |
| **Month 2** | **Fundraising/Sponsorship:** Secure budget from local industry (Fishing/Tourism) to load the cards. |
| **Month 3** | **Soft Launch:** Select 5 Senior Cycle students to pilot the program. |
| **Month 6** | **Expansion:** Open to all eligible students; expand retailer radius to Glengarriff/Bantry. |
