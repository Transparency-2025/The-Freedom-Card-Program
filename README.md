# 🚗 The Freedom Card Program / The Beara Drive Initiative

Documentation of the initiative to support economic mobility and employment in West Cork.

Given the geography of the Beara Peninsula, holding a driver’s license is not just a convenience; it is an essential tool for economic mobility and employment. This program is designed to remove the financial barriers while ensuring funds remain in the local community.

---

## 🌟 Program Overview & Mission Statement

The Beara Drive Initiative is a partnership between Scoil Phobail Bhéara and local industry.

> **Mission:** To empower the youth of the Beara Peninsula with essential mobility skills while reinvesting in the local economy. We aim to remove the financial barrier to driving for students of Scoil Phobail Bhéara, ensuring they are road-ready for employment and education by age 19.
>
> **The Mechanism:** Funds are distributed via the **"Beara Advantage Card"** (a restricted gift card). This creates a circular economy where education funding supports local business, as the card is redeemable *only* at participating local retailers, cafes, and service providers in Castletownbere and West Cork.

## ✅ Core Strategy: The Hybrid Milestone Model

To ensure students don't just take the money and quit, but also have support upfront, a tiered approach is used.

### 💰 Tier 1: The Starter Boost (20% of funds)
Awarded upon provisional license acquisition and proof of booking the first driving lesson.

### 🚀 Tier 2: The Momentum Grant (40% of funds)
Awarded after completing EDT Lesson 6 (the halfway point).

### 🏁 Tier 3: The Completion Reward (40% of funds)
Awarded upon sitting the official driving test (regardless of pass/fail, rewarding the effort and commitment).

## ⚙️ Technical Logistics & Implementation

This section details the critical steps for the gift card platform selection and the program roll-out timeline.

### 💳 Technical Solution Recommendation
The most suitable mechanism to ensure funds are restricted to the local economy while maintaining retailer ease-of-use is the **Town & City Gift Card Platform (Option 1)** or a **Restricted Loop Visa**.

* **Benefit:** The card runs on the Mastercard/Visa network but is "locked" to a specific list of local businesses (via Merchant Category Code or geographic restriction).
* **Retailer Impact:** Merchants do not need new hardware; they process the card like any standard transaction.

### 🗓️ Implementation Timeline

| Timeline | Action Item |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Month 1** | **Merchant Recruitment:** Walk Main Street Castletownbere. Get the driving instructors and 10 key retailers (food/retail) to agree. |
| **Month 2** | **Fundraising/Sponsorship:** Secure budget from local industry (Fishing/Tourism) to load the cards. |
| **Month 3** | **Soft Launch:** Select 5 Senior Cycle students to pilot the program. |
| **Month 6** | **Expansion:** Open to all eligible students; expand retailer radius to Glengarriff/Bantry. |
