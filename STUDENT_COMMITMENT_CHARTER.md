Here is the **Student Commitment Charter**. This document serves two purposes: it is the official application form, and it acts as the "Social Contract" ensuring the student understands that funding is conditional on progress.

I have designed this to be printed on school letterhead.

### Document F: Student Commitment Charter & Application

**Program Name:** The Beara Drive Initiative
**School:** Scoil Phobail Bhéara

#### **1. The Agreement**
**I, [Student Name], understand that:**
This program is an investment in my future mobility and independence. The funds provided are a grant from the local community to assist with the costs of obtaining a full Irish Driver’s License.

In exchange for this financial support, I commit to completing the **12 Essential Driver Training (EDT)** lessons and sitting the RSA Driving Test.

#### **2. The Roadmap (Milestones & Rewards)**

* [ ] **Requirement:** Present a valid **Learner Permit** (Theory Test passed) AND proof of booking my **First EDT Lesson** with a certified instructor.
* [ ] **Reward:** Unlocks initial funding to help pay for the first block of lessons.

**Step 2: The Momentum Grant (Value: €__TBD__)**

3.  **Safety First:** Any reports of reckless driving or road traffic offenses will result in immediate disqualification from the program.

### Strategic Note on Gift Card Distribution

Since you are considering whether to award vouchers *upfront*, *throughout*, or *at the end*, this contract uses the **"Throughout" (Milestone)** model.

**Why this is best for Castletownbere:**
1.  **Cash Flow:** It prevents the school/program from spending the entire budget on a student who quits after Lesson 1.
2.  **Motivation:** It gives the student a "mini-goal" to hit Lesson 6 (the hardest part where motivation often dips).
3.  **Retention:** If they fail the driving test, they have already received the support. We reward the *effort* of taking the test, not just the result, which removes fear of failure.

### Next Step for You

You have the **Names**, **Sponsorship Pitch**, and **Student Contract**.

The final piece of the puzzle is the **Launch Announcement**.

Would you like me to draft a **Press Release / Newsletter Blurb** to announce this to the parents and the wider West Cork community (e.g., for *The Southern Star* or *The text alert system*)?
