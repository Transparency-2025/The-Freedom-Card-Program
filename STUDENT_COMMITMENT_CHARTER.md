Here is the fully developed text for **Document F: Student Commitment Charter**.

To ensure simplicity and compliance, we have integrated the **GDPR/Data Privacy Statement** and the **Safety/Liability Disclaimer** directly into this document. 

This ensures that by signing the application, the student and parent are simultaneously consenting to data processing and waiving liability, preventing the need for three separate forms.
