Thank you for being part of the **Beara Advantage Network**! You are ensuring that every Euro donated to student mobility stays in our community.

#### **Accepting the Beara Advantage Gift Card**

The simplicity of acceptance is key to this program’s success:

* **Payment Process:** The Beara Advantage Card operates like any standard prepaid Visa/Debit card (or One4All, depending on the final platform chosen). **No new hardware or special training is required.**
* **Reconciliation:** Simply process the card transaction through your existing card machine. The funds will be transferred to your account like any other sale, minus your standard transaction fee.
* **No Extra Fees:** The program does **not** charge participating retailers any additional fees to be part of the network.

#### **Tracking the Local Spend (Feedback)**

While the card provider tracks all aggregate spend data, your direct feedback is invaluable:

* If you notice a student making a particularly large purchase that helps them directly (e.g., car insurance, tools for a trade), please share the story (anonymously) with the Program Coordinator.
* We will send a short, optional **Program Feedback Form** every six months to gauge the impact on local trade.

**Questions?** Please direct all inquiries to **[Coordinator Name]** at **[Coordinator Email]** or [School Phone Number].
