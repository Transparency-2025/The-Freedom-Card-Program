This methodology provides a comprehensive framework to assess both the **likelihood of successful launch** and the **long-term success** of the Beara Drive Initiative against its financial and non-financial goals.

# Program Assessment Methodology

This methodology uses a two-part framework: **Feasibility Scorecard (Launch)** and **Impact Scorecard (Success)**.

## Part 1: The Feasibility Scorecard (Likelihood to Launch)

This assessment focuses on the current state of documentation and resources required to move from planning to operation. A program's likelihood to launch is high when operational and financial risks are minimized and resources are secured.

### 1. Financial Viability Score (Critical)

This score assesses if the program is funded and fiscally healthy for **Year 1 launch**.

| Metric | Target | Status (Current Score) | Rationale/Data Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Unrestricted Fund Balance** | **€0.00** (Minimum) | **(€500) Deficit** (See SOFA) | Administrative costs currently exceed unrestricted income. **Launch Risk:** High (Need to find a sponsor for Admin costs). |
| **B. Restricted Funds Secured** | **100%** of Target | **€10,000** (100% of Target) | Sufficient funds secured for the student card value (the core program cost). |
| **C. Card Platform Selection** | **100%** Confirmed | **0%** Confirmed | Card provider selection (e.g., restricted MCC/Geo-fencing) is critical for the "Circular Economy" model. **Launch Risk:** High (No launch without a working card system). |

| Launch Condition | Score |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Launch Risk** (Avg. of A, B, C) | **Moderate-High** (Requires financial fix and card provider sign-off). |

### 2. Operational Readiness Score (Logistics)

This score assesses the internal systems and external partnerships necessary for Day 1 operation.

| Metric | Target | Status (Current Score) | Rationale/Data Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Merchant Network Enrollment** | **10 Key Retailers** | **~50%** (Estimated) | Retailer Opt-In One-Pager is created, but no actual merchant count is available. Must secure key partners before launch. |
| **B. Internal Tracking System Setup** | **100%** Complete | **100%** Complete | The `INTERNAL_TRACKING.md` spreadsheet design is robust for student and financial tracking. |
| **C. Legal/Compliance Status** | **100%** Compliant | **100%** Compliant | **Resolved:** GDPR/Data Privacy and Liability are secured via the new `STUDENT_COMMITMENT_CHARTER.md`. |

| Launch Condition | Score |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Operational Readiness** (Avg. of A, B, C) | **High** (The systems are ready; only the merchant count needs verification). |

## Part 2: The Impact Scorecard (Likelihood to Succeed)

This assessment moves beyond the launch to evaluate the program's long-term **financial and non-financial success** against its stated goals.

### 3. Financial/Economic Goals (Success)

Success is defined by the core *Circular Economy* model and long-term financial stability.

| Goal / Target | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Data Source | Success Criteria (Year 1) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Economic Reinvestment** | **Local Spend Percentage** | Card Provider Report (Aggregate Data) | **Target: 80%** of issued card value is spent in the Beara/West Cork network. |
| **Sponsor Retention** | **Sponsor Re-Commitment Rate** | Annual Fundraising Data | **Target: 75%** of Year 1 sponsors commit to Year 2. |
| **Administrative Sustainability** | **Admin/Fundraising Ratio** | SOFA Year 2 Projection | **Target: < 15%** of total funds spent on admin/governance (proving low overhead). |

### 4. Non-Financial Goals (Success)

Success is defined by the social mission: student mobility, independence, and educational commitment.

| Goal / Target | Key Performance Indicator (KPI) | Data Source | Success Criteria (Year 1) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Student Mobility/Independence** | **Full License Acquisition Rate** | `INTERNAL_TRACKING.md` (Part 3) | **Target: 60%** of enrolled students acquire a full license within 18 months of enrollment. |
| **Student Engagement/Commitment** | **Tier 3 Completion Rate** | `INTERNAL_TRACKING.md` (Part 2) | **Target: 90%** of students who start the program must reach Tier 3 (booking the test), proving the Milestone Model works. |
| **Educational Alignment** | **Reduction in Absenteeism** | School Admin Data | **Target: 5% Reduction** in average unauthorized absences for enrolled students vs. non-enrolled cohort (Testing if the program's incentive structure improves school engagement). |

### 5. Annual Review & Reporting (Consolidation)

The results from the Impact Scorecard will be used to generate the **Annual Program Review Report** for the school board and sponsors.

| Action | Document Focus | Timeline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quarterly Update** | Milestones Achieved (Tiers 1 & 2), Total Funds Issued. | Q1, Q2, Q3 |
| **Mid-Year Impact Report** | Aggregate Spend Data (Local Spend %), Progress toward Tier 3. | Q4 |
| **Annual Program Review** | Full License Acquisition Rate, Sponsor Retention, Final SOFA (Restricted/Unrestricted Balance). | End of Academic Year |
